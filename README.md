# Python Code Rizzler

Python Code Rizzler is a GUI application that takes Python code as input, generates an obfuscated version of it, and can execute the obfuscated code. It uses a unique encoding scheme based on binary factorization and underscore variables. This project was inspired by the work of @PwnFunction.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface built with Tkinter
- Input multi-line Python code
- Generate obfuscated code
- Execute the obfuscated code and view output
- Error handling for complex inputs
- Supports most Python code up to 4GB in size

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- No additional external packages required

## Installation

1. Copy the script into a file (e.g., `code_rizzler.py`)
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
3. Run the script directly

## Usage
